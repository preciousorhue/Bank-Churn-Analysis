# Bank Customers Churn Analysis

## Project Overview:

This project report gives a detailed analysis of customer churn patterns using internal bank data, with the aim to analysze churn pattern and give recommendation on how to improve customer retention and satisfy customers using multiple customer segments from the data set - including product usage, age, gender, geography, and account balance to develop actionable strategies.

## Dataset Overview And Tools:

Just 1 duplicates was found, changed values for some column(like exited, it was changed from 1,0 to yes and no), Blank cells were treated, corrected spelling errors and data types errors. I added a new column for the breakdown of customers ages into age brackets to identify trends across life stages. All these were done using Excel(for cleaning) and Excel(Pivot table, slicer(tenure) to filter and Data Visualization)

The dataset consists of 10,000 customer records with the following key attributes:

- Exited (Yes = churned, No = stayed)
- NumOfProducts (1-4)
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age (18-92)
- Geography (France, Germany, Spain)
- Balance, Tenure, and other relevant financial metrics

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

EDA involves exploring the bank customer data to answer key questions, such as:

- What insights can you uncover from the data?
- How do churn trends vary by geography, age group, gender, account balance, or product usage?
- Are there patterns that might predict which customers are most likely to churn?

##  Key Insights/Findings:

- Germany has the highest churn rate (32.6%).
- 41–60 age group churns the most (38.7%).
- Customers with 3-4 products show highest churn (83–100%).
- Female customers churn more than male customers.
- Churned customers hold higher account balances.

## Recommendation:

1. Targeted retention campaigns in Germany and for 41–60 age group.
2. Loyalty programs for multi-product users.
3. Develop churn risk prediction model.
4. Personalize communication by gender.
5. Monitor churn trend monthly.

## Conclusion:

- Churn rates are highest among valuable customers.
- Targeted action is essential to reduce churn and protect revenue.
- A data-driven approach will improve retention outcomes.
